                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning
                    and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
                    page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
                    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
                    between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
                    and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide
                    Web.

                <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our
                    cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a element, which means that the word is
                    to have strong(er) text formatting</p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline
                    elements.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line
                        following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also
                        appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For
                        example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or
                        footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be
                        nested inside another block-level element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the
                        document’s content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not
                        cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an <a>
                            element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as em or strong create emphasis.

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
				greetMe("World");
			</code>

                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!

            <article>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                    names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                    dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                    JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                    "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                    You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                    identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                    _name.

            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                    always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                    warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                    below.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                    called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                    rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                    global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                    context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                    ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>

                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
				defined</code>
